The mugshot image of the original animatronic associated with the active mechanic will appear in the top-left corner of the screen, providing a visual cue for the player. This will help the player quickly identify which mechanic they need to handle. If the mechanic succeeds (only for non-lethal jumpscares, mechanics, and attacks), fails to reach the player, or takes too long to act, they will switch to a different mechanic for their next attack. The mechanics that can be used are: 1. They approach from the left hall. Keep track of them on the monitor and shut the door when they are standing in the doorway. They move faster as the building gets warmer. 2. While they don't care if the music box is wound up, they can grow tired of the selection playing. When the sound of pots and pans stops, you only have a short amount of time to change the music. The Global Music Box can also soothe them. 3. Put on your Freddy Fazbear mask quickly when they sneak into your room to fool them and make them go away. 4. They navigate through the vents, attempting to reach the opening. If they get there, they will jumpscare you. Use the vent-snare to stop them. 5. They will occasionally appear in your office. Throw on your Freddy mask or pull up your monitor quickly to cause them to disappear. 6. When you see them on your monitor, quickly close it or change the cam, otherwise they will jumpscare you and create an audio disturbance. 7. They are invisible to the cameras and can only be seen when they reach your right or left doorway. Close the door on their face to send them back into the darkness! 8. Don't let your mouse cursor linger over them for too long! 9. They make their way toward your office using the air ducts. Use the audio-lure to hold them in place, or the heater to push them back. 10. Check the left and right hallways, then place the wet-floor sign on the same side as them. They won't enter if the sign is in place. 11. They become active from noise and heat. They are too far away from the music box to be soothed by it, but the global music box can calm them down. 12. When they call, quickly mute them, otherwise it will create a lengthy audio disturbance. The mute button will appear in different places each time.",
